# target-mssql

`target-mssql` is a Singer tap for MSSQL.

Build with the [Singer SDK](https://gitlab.com/meltano/singer-sdk).

## Installation

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` Update the below as needed to correctly describe the install procedure. For instance, if you do not have a PyPi repo, or if you want users to directly install from your git repo, you can modify this step as appropriate.

```bash
pipx install target-mssql
```

## Configuration

### Accepted Config Options
```
host: Hostname (example: localhost)
port: example: 1433
database:

trusted_connection: yes # Will use windows authentication 
schema (Optional): will default to whatever the user's default schema is set to if this isn't set

add_record_metadata (Optional): false/true , defaults to false
A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this
tap is available by running:
```

```bash

```

### Source Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` If your tap requires special access on the source system, or any special authentication requirements, provide those here.

## Usage

You can easily run `target-mssql` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](www.meltano.com).

### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
target-mssql --version
target-mssql --help
target-mssql --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` As a first step, scan the entire project for the text "`TODO:`" and complete any recommended steps, deleting the "TODO" references once completed.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `target_mssql/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `target-mssql` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run target-mssql --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any _"TODO"_ items listed in
the file.

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd target-mssql
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke target-mssql --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano etl target-mssql target-jsonl
```
